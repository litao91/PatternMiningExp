Title: Character Trajectories Data Set

Abstract: Multiple, labelled samples of pen tip trajectories recorded whilst 
writing individual characters. All samples are from the same writer, for the 
purposes of primitive extraction. Only characters with a single pen-down segment 
were considered.

Data Set Information:

The characters here were used for a PhD study on primitive extraction using HMM 
based models. The data consists of 2858 character samples, contained in the cell 
array 'mixout'. The struct variable 'consts' contains a field consts.charlabels 
which provides ennummerated labels for the characters. consts.key provides the 
key for each label. The data was captured using a WACOM tablet. 3 Dimensions 
were kept - x, y, and pen tip force. The data has been numerically 
differentiated and Gaussian smoothed, with a sigma value of 2. Data was captured 
at 200Hz. The data was normalised with consts.datanorm. Only characters with a 
single 'PEN-DOWN' segment were considered. Character segmentation was performed 
using a pen tip force cut-off point. The characters have also been shifted so 
that their velocity profiles best match the mean of the set.

Attribute Information:

Each character sample is a 3-dimensional pen tip velocity trajectory. This is 
contained in matrix format, with 3 rows and T columns where T is the length of 
the character sample.
