mixoutALL_shifted.mat:
    The raw trajactory data, for detailed description, please refer to Data_description.

seq.data:
    Extraction of all sequence from the raw data, contains a trajactory each line.

freq_pattern:
    The frequent_pattern mined by the prefixspan algorithm.

feature.out:
    Some pattern extracted from the freq_pattern produce the feature.

seq.py:
    A quick script to separate a file to 20:80 random, for separating training data from 
    testing data.

feature_table_with_label.dat:
    The feature of the sequences generated by the extracted pattern. For example,
    if the sequence contains the 10th feature sequence, then the 10th feature of
    this sequence is 1, otherwise 0.
    This file is generated with the extractFeature program.

feature_reduced_labe:
    Reduce the number of the label from 20 to 10 to have a better result.

temp_p80:
    Data for training.

temp_p20:
    Data for testing.

temp_p80.model:
    The model generated by svm-train
